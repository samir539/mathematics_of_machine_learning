# Notebook README

This Jupyter Notebook covers various optimization methods and concepts in machine learning and linear algebra.

## Sections

1. **Gradient Descent**
   Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization technique widely used in machine learning and optimization tasks. This section provides an overview of gradient descent, explaining how it aims to minimize a cost or loss function by iteratively adjusting model parameters. Code examples illustrate the step-by-step implementation of gradient descent in various scenarios. Pros and cons of gradient descent are discussed, highlighting its efficiency in finding optimal solutions but also addressing potential challenges such as convergence issues.

2. **Gradient Descent with Momentum**
   This section delves into an enhancement of gradient descent known as gradient descent with momentum. Building upon the basic gradient descent, momentum introduces the concept of velocity to aid the optimization process. The benefits of using momentum, such as accelerated convergence and noise reduction, are explained through both intuitive descriptions and coding examples. By examining how momentum improves optimization stability, learners gain insights into when and why to consider this technique.

3. **Newton's Method**
   Newton's method offers an alternative approach to optimization that incorporates second derivatives for faster convergence. This section introduces the basic principles behind Newton's method and demonstrates its implementation using code examples. While Newton's method has advantages in achieving rapid convergence, the computational complexity of second derivative calculations is considered. The section concludes by discussing scenarios where Newton's method excels and potential challenges when dealing with high-dimensional or complex functions.

4. **Linear Regression and Ordinary Least Squares**
   Linear regression is a cornerstone of supervised learning, and ordinary least squares (OLS) serves as a primary method to find the best-fitting line. This section covers the fundamentals of linear regression, explaining how OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals to estimate model parameters. Practical insights into implementing OLS through code examples highlight its application in real-world data analysis. Moreover, the trade-offs and assumptions associated with linear regression are discussed, offering a well-rounded perspective on its utility and limitations.

5. **Condition Number of a Matrix**
   Matrix condition number plays a critical role in understanding the stability of numerical computations involving matrices. This section defines the condition number and its interpretation as a measure of a matrix's sensitivity to changes. The importance of the condition number in optimization tasks is explored, discussing scenarios where a high condition number may lead to numerical instability. By comprehending the relationship between the condition number and the accuracy of matrix operations, learners gain insights into potential challenges and strategies for optimization in numerical computations.
