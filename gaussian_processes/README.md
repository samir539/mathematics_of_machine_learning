# Gaussian Processes Notebook README

This Jupyter Notebook provides an in-depth exploration of Gaussian Processes (GPs), a powerful non-parametric framework for probabilistic modeling and regression.

## Sections

1. **Gaussian Process Prior**
   This section introduces the concept of the Gaussian process prior. A Gaussian process is defined by a mean function and a covariance (kernel) function. The choice of kernel shapes the GP's prior assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We consider the influence of different kernel parameters on the smoothness and behavior of the GP prior.

2. **Gaussian Process Regression**
   This section dives into Gaussian process regression, a method for modeling functions and making predictions based on observed data. Learn how GPs extend linear regression by capturing complex, non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. We consider how the GP's posterior distribution is updated based on observed data, yielding a predictive distribution for new inputs.

3. **Effect of Kernel Hyperparameters**
   This section examines the role of kernel hyperparameters in Gaussian process regression. Understand how parameters like length scales and signal variance impact the behavior of the GP model. We consider the trade-offs between overfitting and underfitting as hyperparameters are tuned, and gain insights into optimizing their values for better predictive performance.

4. **Model Selection**
   This section discusses the challenge of model selection in Gaussian processes. Discover techniques for assessing model fit and choosing appropriate kernel functions. We consider cross-validation, information criteria, and Bayesian model selection approaches to ensure your GP model captures the data's underlying patterns effectively.

5. **Application to Mauna Loa Atmospheric CO2 Data**
   This section demonstrates the application of Gaussian processes to a real-world dataset: the Mauna Loa atmospheric CO2 data. We explore how GPs can capture temporal patterns in CO2 levels and make predictions beyond the observed data range. 

6. **Specifying the Kernel Function**
   This section explores the art of specifying kernel functions in Gaussian processes. Different kernels capture different assumptions about the underlying data structure. We think about popular kernel functions like Radial Basis Function (RBF), Mat√©rn, and more.
