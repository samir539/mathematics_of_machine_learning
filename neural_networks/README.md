# Neural Networks Notebook README

This Jupyter Notebook covers a comprehensive exploration of Neural Networks (NN), a fundamental concept in deep learning and machine learning.

## Sections

1. **This section covers Gradient Descent with Autodiff**
   This section covers the training process of neural networks using the gradient descent optimization method in conjunction with automatic differentiation (autodiff). Gradient descent involves iteratively adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the loss function. Autodiff automates the calculation of gradients, which are crucial for determining the direction and magnitude of parameter updates. The combination of these techniques results in an efficient and automated approach to fine-tuning neural network models during training.

2. **This section covers Autodiff in PyTorch**
   This section considers the concept of automatic differentiation in the PyTorch library. Automatic differentiation allows the computation of gradients without manually deriving and implementing gradient formulas. PyTorch's dynamic computation graph enables automatic differentiation to be seamlessly integrated into the model-building process. By automatically calculating gradients during the backward pass, PyTorch simplifies the implementation of complex neural network architectures and accelerates the development of gradient-based optimization algorithms.

3. **This section covers Stochastic Gradient Descent**
   This section considers stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization technique. SGD improves upon traditional gradient descent by randomly selecting subsets of data, known as mini-batches, for computing gradient updates. This introduces an element of randomness that can lead to faster convergence and escape local minima. By updating the model's parameters based on these mini-batch gradients, SGD offers a more computationally efficient alternative to batch gradient descent, particularly in large-scale training scenarios.

4. **This section covers Minibatch Gradient Descent**
   This section introduces minibatch gradient descent, a compromise between batch and stochastic gradient descent. Minibatch gradient descent divides the dataset into smaller batches, striking a balance between efficiency and convergence speed. While providing smoother updates compared to stochastic gradient descent, minibatch gradient descent still benefits from the randomization introduced by mini-batch sampling. This technique is widely used in practice due to its ability to leverage parallel processing and optimize memory utilization.

5. **This section covers Fully Connected Layers**
   This section considers fully connected layers, a fundamental component of neural networks. Fully connected layers, also known as dense layers, play a crucial role in transforming input data through weighted connections between neurons. Each neuron in a fully connected layer is connected to every neuron in the preceding and subsequent layers. These layers enable neural networks to capture complex relationships within the data, making them a cornerstone of various neural network architectures.

6. **This section covers NN for Classification**
   This section considers the application of neural networks to classification tasks. Classification neural networks are designed to categorize input data into predefined classes or categories. These networks consist of layers that transform input data and gradually distill it into class predictions. Training classification neural networks involves optimizing model parameters to minimize a classification-specific loss function. The section covers the construction and training of classification neural networks using PyTorch.

7. **This section covers Loss Functions**
   This section considers loss functions, which quantify the dissimilarity between predicted and actual values. Loss functions are fundamental in training neural networks as they provide a measure of how well the model's predictions align with the ground truth. The choice of loss function depends on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.). This section introduces common loss functions and demonstrates their integration into neural network architectures.

8. **This section covers Evaluation Metrics**
   This section focuses on evaluating the performance of trained neural networks. Evaluation metrics provide quantitative measures of how well a model performs on unseen data. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are explained. These metrics help assess the model's ability to make correct predictions, especially in classification tasks. The section covers the computation and interpretation of these evaluation metrics.

9. **This section covers Training and Evaluation Process**
   This section outlines the holistic process of training and evaluating neural networks. It starts with data preparation, including data preprocessing and partitioning into training and validation sets. The training process involves iterating through epochs, where the model's parameters are updated using optimization algorithms like gradient descent. Finally, the trained model is evaluated using validation or test data to assess its real-world performance.
