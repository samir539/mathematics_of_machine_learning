# Support Vector Machines (SVM) Notebook README

This Jupyter Notebook covers fundamental concepts and advanced aspects of Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful classification algorithm used in machine learning.

## Sections

1. **Linear SVM Fundamentals**
   In this section, we loo into the basics of Support Vector Machines, focusing on the linear SVM.  We look at  how SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes. The mathematical formulation of SVM's objective function and the concept of support vectors are explained. 

2. **Beyond Linear Boundaries**
   Beyond linear boundaries, SVM can be extended to handle non-linearly separable data using techniques like the kernel trick. In this section, we explore kernel functions that transform data into higher-dimensional spaces, allowing SVM to capture complex decision boundaries. We consider the concept of kernel functions, such as the polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, and look to apply them in SVM through code examples.
